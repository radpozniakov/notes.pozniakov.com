A few weeks ago, we sat down with the team that leads review in the Chrome Web Store to ask your questions. We covered a number of topics including why review is important, common mistakes the team sees and how the process works behind the scenes. We were particularly excited to be able to answer some of the questions you shared beforehand in the [chromium-extensions mailing list](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/chromium-extensions).
